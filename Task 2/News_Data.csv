"The vote was 54-46, with two members of the Democratic caucus joining all but one Republican in support, sending the bill to President Donald Trump�s desk for a signature. But prior to final passage, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and nine other Democrats helped the measure clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle in the GOP-controlled chamber. 
",Politics
"Tensions boiled over after Schumer first announced on Thursday he would vote in favor of advancing the GOP spending bill, despite Democratic fears that the measure passed by the House would enable Trump and Elon Musk to further lay off government workers and seek to eliminate programs without congressional input. ",Politics
"�Musk has told everybody he wants a shutdown because he knows it will help him achieve his horrible goal of just decimating the federal government from one end to the other,� Schumer said. �In other words, if government were to shut down, DOGE has a plan in place to exploit the crisis for maximum destruction.� ",Politics
"Trump praised Schumer on Truth Social, calling his announcement a �really good and smart move� that took �guts and courage.� House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California responded to the president�s post: �When Donald Trump wakes up in the morning and says, �You�re doing the right things Senate Democrats,� we don�t feel that is the right place to be.�",Politics
"I�ve been speaking to a number of Democratic sources, and while some were relieved by Schumer�s move, one congressional aide told me to expect �severe� blowback from the base. The aide also noted the divide seems to be falling largely along generational lines, with some of the newest voices in the Senate being some of the staunchest opponents to Schumer�s strategy.",Politics
"Why the backlash? Well, one, a number of vulnerable House Democrats in Trump districts opposed the bill earlier this week, and now feel like they took a tough vote for no reason. Second, some Democrats feel as though keeping the government open is basically giving Trump and Musk a green light to move forward with their deep cuts. And third, perhaps most importantly, many in the party saw this fight as the best opportunity to register their opposition to Trump. The question is: If not now, when?

"After a swift and improbable ascent, Mark Carney, the former Bank of Canada governor, took office as the country�s 24th prime minister on Friday morning. A crisis-less Carney, with his Bank of England, Bank of Canada, Goldman Sachs, Harvard, and Oxford credentials, likely would have had a more grueling race to the top if not for the U.S. trade war provocations, and been dismissed as a wealthy cosmopolitan banker type, far removed from the struggles of ordinary people. But he has emerged as a champion for many anxious Canadians consigned to a once-unfathomable dystopia: being held hostage to an American president bent on wrecking the North American economy.",Politics
"Amid a rare surge of national pride, even voters who might be otherwise leery of his globalist gloss admit that Carney has serious �skillz,� as the kids say, to match the Trump team brain cell for brain cell in the trade war, which is preferable to the alternative of a career politician with no special expertise in Canada�s domestic or international economic policymaking.
",Politics
"Recent polling suggests that the once-hapless Liberals are within striking distance of a Conservative Party that once expected to waltz into power. Outgoing leader Justin Trudeau created the conditions for Carney�s accession. As Trudeau neared his ten-year milestone, the usual shelf life of a Canadian prime minister, he embarked on a journey of self-defenestration. When his perfunctory talks with President Donald Trump proved fruitless, he returned to Ottawa to talk his finance minister out of her job. Instead, she invited him to take the job and shove it, precipitating his downfall faster than a pronghorn across the Saskatchewan prairie.

"Just how conservative is Poilievre?

"The old clich� exists for a reason: An apple a day benefits your whole body in multiple ways. One of the most widely grown and eaten fruits in the world, they come in more than 7,500 varieties. They are healthiest when you eat them fresh and whole (as opposed to pre-sliced, juiced, or as applesauce). A medium one has about 80 calories, 1 gram of protein, 19 grams of natural sugar, and zero fat, sodium, or cholesterol. ",Health
"That�s where apples store two-thirds of the fiber that keeps your digestive system on track. The shiny skin also holds lots of antioxidants, or natural substances that help protect your cells from some of the damage that may lead to cancer, heart disease, and stroke. If you�re concerned about pesticides, give it a good wash before you sink your teeth into its sweet flesh. ",Health
"Apples have more of the plant pigment quercetin than most other fruits and vegetables. This plant-derived chemical called a flavonoid protects cells throughout your body, including the ones in your brain. These fruits are also high in antioxidants that may help offset the memory loss caused by various types of damage to your cells. One small study suggested that apple juice improved the mood and behavior of people with moderate to severe Alzheimer�s disease",Health
"Flavonoids give apples their color, protect them from harmful elements in the environment, and repair damage to their skin and cells. These natural chemicals may be good for you, too. Quercetin, which can help brain cells, protected pancreas cells from cancer in lab studies and holds promise to help people, too. Research is ongoing. ",Health
"Your pancreas plays a key role in processing the sugar in your bloodstream. The flavonoids in apples may help keep the cells in your pancreas healthy and able to perform this important job. That may help lower your risk for type 2 diabetes. In one 9-year study, people who ate one or more apples a day were 28% less likely to get type 2 diabetes than those who didn�t eat them. ",Health
"One medium apple with skin has 4.3 grams of fiber. This nutrient slows down your digestion and helps you feel fuller longer. These fruits also have a low glycemic load, which means they won�t spike your blood sugar too high and trick you into thinking you�re still hungry. These satisfying effects can keep you from snacking and help you maintain your weight. ",Health
One group of researchers found that people who ate at least one apple a day were a third less likely to get colon cancer than those who did not. The healthy helping of both fiber and flavonoids may help protect the lining of the intestines and keep the cells healthy.,Health
"Apples are a natural source of pectin, a soluble fiber that moves food through your digestive system and keeps you regular. Bonus benefit: Your good gut bacteria love to feed on pectin. Some experts think that pectin helps the good bacteria multiply, which may help ward off some chronic diseases and cancer in the gut.",Health
"In lab studies, the combination of plant chemicals, pectin, and fiber in apples helped protect heart and blood vessel cells from damage. The pectin and fiber can also help lower LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol that can build up in your arteries and lead to heart disease.",Health
"Apples, like other fruits and vegetables, have natural anti-inflammatory and antihistamine properties, which means they may help take a bite out of asthma and other breathing problems. One study of women who ate apples while pregnant showed that their children were less likely to have symptoms of asthma and wheezing by age 5. Some studies show that people who eat more fruits and vegetables are less likely to have asthma. ",Health
"They can�t compete with oranges, but apples have 10% of the vitamin C you need every day. That plus the soluble fiber you get from pectin makes this fruit a delicious defense against any germ that attacks your immune system. And if you do get sick, apples may even help you bounce back quicker. ",Health
"For all its health benefits, one part of this fruit is forbidden -- in large quantities, that is. The seeds contain amygdalin, a compound that becomes cyanide in your body. If you accidentally eat a seed, it won�t poison you -- your body can detoxify small amounts of cyanide on its own. You�d have to chew seeds from many apples at once very carefully to release enough amygdalin in your system to be harmful. ",Health

"Prized for its versatility, taste and nutritional advantages amid an increasing number of plant-based diets, asparagus is having a moment. With the worldwide asparagus market now valued at a whopping $28.6 billion, it's a vegetable many people can't get enough of.  ""There's a lot to love about asparagus,"" says Jen Messer, a nutrition consultant and registered dietitian at Jen Messer Nutrition. ""It has a unique flavor and texture, is packed with fiber, vitamins and antioxidants and is great to add to salads, soups or simply roasted as a side dish.""",Health
"Asparagus is a nutrient-dense food that provides a host of important vitamins and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and niacin � plus nearly two grams of both protein and dietary fiber in only about seven stalks, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nutrients like these ""are helpful in supporting gut health, immune health, blood sugar stabilization and improved cholesterol levels,"" says LeeAnn Weintraub, a registered dietitian and nutrition consultant based in Los Angeles.",Health
"The vegetable is also a good source of folate, which can further help ""with things like vision, digestion and disease prevention,"" explains Kristen Smith, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. She adds that asparagus also serves as a prebiotic, which means it provides beneficial gut bacteria. 
",Health
"But it's not all good news. Due to its high fiber content, some people ""might experience bloating with a high consumption of asparagus,"" says Messer. ""And because we don�t digest fiber, our gut microbes ferment it for us and in doing so can create gas,"" she adds. ",Health
"Beyond such potential abdominal discomfort, the vegetable is also notorious for affecting the smell of urine. This unpleasant odor, Smith explains, is the result of something called asparagusic acid, which is unique to the vegetable. ""This acid breaks down into sulfur compounds during digestion and these sulfur byproducts evaporate quickly when you urinate, causing a notable smell,"" she says. ",Health
"The health benefits of eating asparagus are similar whether you eat raw or cooked asparagus, but the bloating and gas associated with the vegetable can be reduced if you cook your asparagus before eating it, Smith says, because cooking it can soften the vegetable's cell walls, making it easier to digest.",Health
"Think of a skin reset as a detox for your face. ""A skin reset is about stripping things back to the basics - just a gentle cleanser, a solid moisturiser, and SPF - so your skin can breathe, repair, and reset,"" explains Malvika Jain, founder and CEO of Sereko. More than dermatologists, young women these days rely on influencers for their daily dose of skincare advice, which often leads to disastrous effects on the skin. A one-size-fits-all approach is anything but helpful when it comes to skincare.",Health
"Overuse of skincare products, especially actives like retinol, AHAs, and BHAs, can weaken the skin barrier, leading to inflammation, sensitivity, and breakouts. A reset allows your skin to breathe with the most minimal and basic ingredients, making it suitable for every skin type. It's about letting the skin heal naturally.",Health
"If your usual products suddenly start stinging or burning, your skin barrier might be compromised due to overuse of actives. Over-exfoliation and excessive cleansing can strip your skin, making it tight, rough, and prone to peeling. If your skin constantly looks inflamed, your routine might be too harsh or overloaded. Sometimes, too many products can lead to clogged pores, inflammation, or even a damaged microbiome. These are signs that your skin needs a reset to help restore balance,"" she adds.",Health

"Dumbbells and barbells are effective free weights for building muscle, but which is better? We will explore the debate on dumbbells vs. barbells and also see which exercises they are best for. This will enable you to make well-guided decisions. It�s time to dive in!",Health
"One benefit of dumbbells is that they are quicker to change out, allowing smoother workout progression. Also, the best dumbbell exercises, like bicep curls, engage your stabilizer muscles and help to improve balance. Dumbbells are versatile and flexible, allowing you to target different muscle groups. They are easy for beginners to get used to since they offer a more natural range of movement, closely simulating everyday activities. They will also help you save space, especially in home gyms.",Health
"With barbells, you can easily add weight plates to the bar for gradual advancement in resistance training. Since they generally hold more weight, they are effective for heavier lifting.

In addition, barbells are slightly more restricted, so it is easier to maintain proper form and lift heavier weights without frequent adjustments, reducing the risk of injuries.

"Measles is preventable, thanks to a highly effective vaccine. Experts recommend that children get the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine in two doses: the first between 12 months and 15 months of age, and a second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles infection; two doses are about 97% effective.",Health
"The increased concern about measles cases can be attributed to falling vaccination rates and to increased travel, which can result in unvaccinated people acquiring measles abroad and bringing it back to the US, according to the CDC, which occurred in 2019.",Health

There have been an average of about eight outbreaks per year � ranging from 1 to 25 annually � and most years, at least 60% of all reported cases have been tied to outbreaks.
